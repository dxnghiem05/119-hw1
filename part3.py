Part 3: Short Exercises on the Shell

For the third and last part of this homework,
we will complete a few tasks related to shell programming
and shell commands, particularly, with relevance to how
the shell is used in data science.

Please note:
The "project proposal" portion will be postponed to part of Homework 2.

===== Questions 1-5: Setup Scripting =====

1. For this first part, let's write a setup script
that downloads a dataset from the web,
clones a GitHub repository, and runs the Python script
contained in `script.py` on the dataset in question.

For the download portion, we have written a helper
download_file(url, filename) which downloads the file
at `url` and saves it in `filename`.

You should use Python subprocess to run all of these operations.

To test out your script, and as your answer to this part,
run the following:
    setup(
        "https://github.com/DavisPL-Teaching/119-hw1",
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavisPL-Teaching/119-hw1/refs/heads/main/data/test-input.txt",
        "test-script.py"
    )

Then read the output of `output/test-output.txt`,
convert it to an integer and return it. You should get "12345".

Note:
Running this question will leave an extra repo 119-hw1 lying around in your repository.
We recommend adding this to your .gitignore file so it does not
get uploaded when you submit.

def download_file(url, filename):
    r = requests.get(url)
    with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(r.content)

def clone_repo(repo_url):
    if not os.path.exists("119-hw1"):
        subprocess.run(["git", "clone", repo_url], check=True)
    else:
        print("Repository already exists, skipping clone.")

    # Download the file
    data_filename = "input.txt"
    download_file(data_url, data_filename)
    # Clone the repository
    clone_repo(repo_url)
    # Run the script (assuming script expects the input file as argument)
    run_script(script_path, data_filename)

def q1():
    # Run the setup as described
    test_repo = "https://github.com/DavisPL-Teaching/119-hw1"
    test_data = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavisPL-Teaching/119-hw1/refs/heads/main/data/test-input.txt"
    test_script = "test-script.py"
    
    # Ensure output directory exists
    os.makedirs("output", exist_ok=True)
    
    setup(test_repo, test_data, test_script)
    
    # Read the output
    with open("output/test-output.txt", "r") as f:
        result = int(f.read().strip())
    
    return result

"""
2.
Suppose you are on a team of 5 data scientists working on
a project; every 2 weeks you need to re-run your scripts to
fetch the latest data and produce the latest analysis.

a. When might you need to use a script like setup() above in
this scenario?

=== ANSWER Q2a BELOW ===
you can use setup() when your team needs the latest data and scripts on a new machine or after a major update which makes setting up easier and faster
=== END OF Q2a ANSWER ===

Do you see an alternative to using a script like setup()?

=== ANSWER Q2b BELOW ===
Instead of setup(), you can use Docker or conda environments so everything is ready without having to manually download the files
=== END OF Q2b ANSWER ===

3.
Now imagine we have to re-think our script to
work on a brand-new machine, without any software installed.
(For example, this would be the case if you need to run
your pipeline inside an Amazon cloud instance or inside a
Docker instance -- to be more specific you would need
to write something like a Dockerfile, see here:
https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/
which is basically a list of shell commands.)

Don't worry, we won't test your code for this part!
I just want to see that you are thinking about how
shell commands can be used for setup and configuration
necessary for data processing pipelines to work.

Think back to HW0. What sequence of commands did you
need to run?
Write a function setup_for_new_machine() that would
be able to run on a brand-new machine and set up
everything that you need.

Assume that you need your script to work on all of the packages
that we have used in HW1 (that is, any `import` statements
and any other software dependencies).

Assume that the new server machine is identical
in operating system and architecture to your own,
but it doesn't have any software installed.
It has Python 3.12
and conda or pip3 installed to get needed packages.

Hint: use subprocess again!

Hint: search for "import" in parts 1-3. Did you miss installing
any packages?
"""

def setup_for_new_machine():
    import subprocess
    subprocess.run(["pip3", "install", "pandas", "matplotlib", "requests"], check=True)

def q3():
    return "Linux"  


"""
4. This question is open ended :)
It won't be graded for correctness.

What percentage of the time do you think real data scientists
working in larger-scale projects in industry have to write
scripts like setup() and setup_for_new_machine()
in their day-to-day jobs?

=== ANSWER Q4 BELOW ===
I think I least a quarter of their time on setup scripts since most of their time should be on the analysis and modeling
=== END OF Q4 ANSWER ===

5.
Copy your setup_for_new_machine() function from Q3
(remove the other code in this file)
to a new script and run it on a friend's machine who
is not in this class. Did it work? What problems did you run into?

Only answer this if you actually did the above.
Paste the output you got when running the script on the
new machine:

If you don't have a friend's machine, please speculate about
what might happen if you tried. You can guess.

=== ANSWER Q5 BELOW ===
NEED TO FILL THIS OUT
=== END OF Q5 ANSWER ===

===== Questions 6-9: A comparison of shell vs. Python =====

The shell can also be used to process data.

This series of questions will be in the same style as part 2.
Let's import the part2 module:
"""

import part2
import pandas as pd

"""
Write two versions of a script that takes in the population.csv
file and produces as output the number of rows in the file.
The first version should use shell commands and the second
should use Pandas.

For technical reasons, you will need to use
os.popen instead of subprocess.run for the shell version.
Example:
    os.popen("echo hello").read()

Runs the command `echo hello` and returns the output as a string.

Hints:
    1. Given a file, you can print it out using
        cat filename

    2. Given a shell command, you can use the `tail` command
        to skip the first line of the output. Like this:

    (shell command that spits output) | tail -n +2

    Note: if you are curious why +2 is required here instead
        of +1, that is an odd quirk of the tail command.
        See here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/604871/2038713

    3. Given a shell command, you can use the `wc` command
        to count the number of lines in the output

   (shell command that spits output) | wc -l

NOTE:
The shell commands above require that population.csv
has a newline at the end of the file.
Otherwise, it will give an off-by-one error
FYI, if this were not the case you can replace
    cat filename
with:
    (cat filename ; echo)
.
"""

def pipeline_shell():
    output = os.popen("tail -n +2 data/population.csv | wc -l").read()
    return int(output.strip())

def pipeline_pandas():
    df = pd.read_csv("data/population.csv")
    return len(df)

def q6():
    shell_rows = pipeline_shell()
    pandas_rows = pipeline_pandas()
    assert shell_rows == pandas_rows
    return shell_rows


"""
Let's do a performance comparison between the two methods.

Use use your ThroughputHelper and LatencyHelper classes
from part 2 to get answers for both pipelines.

Additionally, generate a plot and save it in
    output/part3-q7.png

7. Throughput
"""

def q7():
    from part2 import ThroughputHelper
    h = ThroughputHelper()
    h.add_pipeline("shell", len(open("data/population.csv").readlines()), pipeline_shell)
    h.add_pipeline("pandas", len(pd.read_csv("data/population.csv")), pipeline_pandas)
    return h.compare_throughput()


"""
8. Latency

For latency, remember that we should create a version of the
pipeline that processes only a single row! (As in Part 2).
However, for this question only, it is OK if you choose to run
latency on the entire pipeline instead.

Additionally, generate a plot and save it in
    output/part3-q8.png
"""

def q8():
    from part2 import LatencyHelper
    h = LatencyHelper()
    h.add_pipeline("shell", lambda: pipeline_shell())
    h.add_pipeline("pandas", lambda: pipeline_pandas())
    return h.compare_latency()


"""
9. Which method is faster?
Comment on anything else you notice below.

=== ANSWER Q9 BELOW ===
Pandas is faster than shell commands since it works in memory and avoid extra processes along the way, whereas shell commands are slower for big dataset
